论文名：SeChannel: A Secure and Lightweight Channel Protection Approach for TEE Systems

论文简介：

在基于ARM TrustZone技术的可信执行环境（TEE）系统中，跨世界通信通道存在安全隐患，现有保护方法存在不足。论文提出SeChannel，这是一种轻量级的通信通道保护方案。它借助ARM可信固件（ATF）实现细粒度访问控制，通过验证共享内存地址和TA会话来防止不受信任的Rich OS进行未经授权的访问。SeChannel无需额外硬件，避免了加密和内存复制带来的性能开销。在Hikey960开发板上基于OP - TEE实现的原型显示，SeChannel能有效增强通信通道安全性，且性能开销可忽略不计。

论文名：USB Catcher: Detection of Controlled Emissions via Conducted Compromising Emanations
论文简介：The security of the Universal Serial Bus (USB) is critical due to its widespread use. Attackers can exploit electromagnetic emissions from USB devices to steal sensitive information, and detecting controlled emissions from USB has long been a challenging issue. Existing methods for detecting controlled emissions based on radiated compromising emanations are often hindered by environmental noise, electromagnetic interference, and device variability, leading to reduced detection capability. To address these challenges, this paper, for the first time, proposes a method for detecting controlled emissions from USB devices through conducted compromising emanations. First, we construct a dataset of USB leakage signals based on conducted compromising emanations. Then, we propose a multiscale time-frequency processing technique for USB leakage signals, applying time-frequency analysis to generate spectrograms containing both time-domain and frequency-domain features. By using multiscale data augmentation, the detection model's accuracy and generalization are enhanced. Finally, we employ a Residual Network (ResNet)-based deep learning model to automatically extract features and detect abnormal signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this method can effectively identify controlled emissions from USB devices, achieving an AUC of 99.52% and an ACC of 96.74%, providing a robust solution for anomaly detection and enhancing the security of USB devices.
