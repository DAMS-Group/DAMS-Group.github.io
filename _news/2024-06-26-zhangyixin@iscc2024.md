论文名：A Conducted Compromising Emanations Method on High-Speed USB Devices via USB Hubs
论文简介：High-speed USB is prominently used in electronic devices, such as computers and mass storage devices, where sensitive data may be stored. There are risks of information leakage by conducted compromising emanations during data transmission with high-speed USB devices. Therefore, it is of great significance to research and analyze the security issues of high-speed USB for maintaining information security. However, little research is done on conducted compromising emanations of high-speed USB. In this paper, we propose a method to attack high-speed USB devices by conducted compromising emanations through USB hubs. First, we construct a USB hub-based attack model for high-speed USB devices. Then, we design a filtering mechanism with Kaiser filter to preprocess the collected leakage signal to obtain a cleaner leakage signal. Finally, by decoding and reconstructing the processed signal, the attack on the high-speed USB device is realized. Extensive experiments show that the method proposed in this paper can successfully attack high-speed USB devices, achieving a Bit-level Accuracy of 99.69% and a Character-level Accuracy of 98.04%. This demonstrates that our attack method is effective and verifies the existence of information leakage risk from high-speed USB devices through conducted compromising emanations in USB Hubs.
