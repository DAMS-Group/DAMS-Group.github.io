  author={Zhou, Qihang and Cao, Wenzhuo and Jia, Xiaoqi and Liu, Peng and Zhang, Shengzhi and Chen, Jiayun and Xu, Shaowen and Song, Zhenyu},
  abstract={Containers have become widely adopted in cloud platforms due to their efficient deployment and high resource utilization. However, their weak isolation has always posed a significant security concern. In this paper, we propose RContainer, a novel secure container architecture that protects containers from untrusted operating systems and enforces strong isolation among containers by extending ARM Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) hardware primitives. RContainer introduces a small, trusted mini-OS that runs alongside the deprivileged OS, responsible for monitoring the control flow between the operating system and containers. Additionally, RContainer uses shim-style isolation, creating an isolated physical address space called con-shim for each container at the kernel layer through the Granule Protection Check mechanism. We have implemented RContainer on ARMv9-A Fixed Virtual Platform and ARMv8 hardware SoC for security analysis and performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that RContainer can significantly enhance container security with a modest performance overhead and a minimal Trusted Computing Base (TCB).},

  title={Silence False Alarms: Identifying Anti-Reentrancy Patterns on Ethereum to Refine Smart Contract Reentrancy Detection},
  author={Song, Qiyang and Huang, Heqing and Jia, Xiaoqi and Xie, Yuanbo and Cao, Jiahao},
  abstract={Reentrancy vulnerabilities in Ethereum smart contracts have caused significant financial losses, prompting the creation of several automated reentrancy detectors. However, these detectors frequently yield a high rate of false positives due to coarse detection rules, often misclassifying contracts protected by anti-reentrancy patterns as vulnerable. Thus, there is a critical need for the development of specialized automated tools to assist these detectors in accurately identifying anti-reentrancy patterns. While existing code analysis techniques show promise for this specific task, they still face significant challenges in recognizing anti-reentrancy patterns. These challenges are primarily due to the complex and varied features of anti-reentrancy patterns, compounded by insufficient prior knowledge about these features. This paper introduces AutoAR, an automated recognition system designed to explore and identify prevalent anti-reentrancy patterns in Ethereum contracts. AutoAR utilizes a specialized graph representation, RentPDG, combined with a data filtration approach, to effectively capture anti-reentrancy-related semantics from a large pool of contracts. Based on RentPDGs extracted from these contracts, AutoAR employs a recognition model that integrates a graph auto-encoder with a clustering technique, specifically tailored for precise anti-reentrancy pattern identification. Experimental results show AutoAR can assist existing detectors in identifying 12 prevalent anti-reentrancy patterns with 89% accuracy, and when integrated into the detection workflow, it significantly reduces false positives by over 85%.},

  title={CubeVisor: A Multi-realm Architecture Design for Running VM with ARM CCA},
  author={Chen, Jiayun and Zhou, Qihang and Yan, Xiaolong and Jiang, Nan and Jia, Xiaoqi and Zhang, Weijuan},
  abstract={Cloud computing nowadays provides flexible and scalable computing services, using different hardware platforms, including ARM. Virtualization allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to share the physical resources of a host machine. However, these technologies have security risks. The hypervisor is the software that controls VMs, and it can be exploited or manipulated by hackers or untrusted providers. ARM CCA, a novel feature of ARMv9-A, allows confidential VMs to run in a new security state called realm. However, the current CCA prototype still has some problems, including risks brought by external libraries, single point of failure, highly privileged TF-RMM and costly world switch. In this paper, we introduce CubeVisor, a new secure virtualization architecture based on ARM CCA. It uses the idea of the Cube, which is a combination of a hypervisor and a VM, protecting each Cube from other Cubes or components. The CubeVisor also improves performance by optimizing memory allocation and world-switching processes. We implement prototypes on both software-based ARM FVP platform and hardware-based ARM Cortex-A platform for evaluations. The results show that the CubeVisor can protect VMs well and has very low overhead compared to the CCA based virtualization methods.},

  author={Xu, Shaowen and Zhou, Qihang and Zhang, Zhicong and Jia, Xiaoqi and Liu, Donglin and Huang, Heqing and Du, Haichao and Song, Zhenyu},
  abstract={Containers are widely used in multi-tenant cloud computing for their ease of deployment, minimal overhead, and fast start-up. However, the intrinsic shared kernel model of containers poses significant security threats, risking confidentiality and integrity from co-located containers or compromised OS. Researchers have proposed various methods to protect containers from untrusted OS, but few consider both the universality and efficiency. In this paper, we present ConMonitor---a lightweight and efficient container protection architecture. ConMonitor protects the security of container application data by introducing a compact virtualization software, called ConVisor, as a trusted computing base. ConVisor enforces isolation of the physical memory between containers and the kernel, and monitors the sensitive operations performed by the OS. To ensure the security of ConMonitor, we implement a Container Guardian to serve as an intermediary for the kernel, managing sensitive operations. Moreover, we also leverage the VMFUNC feature to achieve fast context switching, thereby mitigating the performance penalty associated with frequent context switching. We have implemented ConMonitor on Intel CPU with Virtualization Technology, and the evaluation results show that ConMonitor can protect the security of container applications with a negligible performance overhead.},

  author={Zhou, Qihang and Cao, Wenzhuo and Jia, Xiaoqi and Zhang, Shengzhi and Chen, Jiayun and Jiang, Nan and Zhang, Weijuan and Du, Haichao and Song, Zhenyu and Huang, Qingjia},
  abstract={Virtualization is the cornerstone of cloud computing, but the hypervisor, the crucial software component that enables virtualization, is known to suffer from various attacks. It is challenging to secure the hypervisor due to at least two reasons. On one hand, commercial hypervisors are usually integrated into a privileged Operating System (OS), which brings in a larger attack surface. On the other hand, multiple Virtual Machines (VM) share a single hypervisor, thus a malicious VM could leverage the hypervisor as a bridge to launch “cross-VM” attacks. In this work, we propose HClave, an isolated execution environment (IEE) design for hypervisor runtime. We decouple the virtualization layer into a tiny trusted computing base (TCB), a large non-secure OS, and multiple HClave IEEs through a bidirectional isolation approach. HClave extends the nested kernel approach to deprive the traditional OS from accessing the tiny TCB’s memory and creates an IEE for hypervisor runtime. We implemented HClave based on KVM and evaluated its effectiveness and efficiency through case studies. Experimental results show that HClave can significantly improve the security of the hypervisor with reasonable runtime overhead.},

  abstract={Device emulation is a vital aspect of virtualization, yet remains vulnerable to security threats. Prior research has focused on monitoring I/O data flow or identifying internal device anomalies but often falls short in precision and automation. In this paper, we propose a novel method that leverages the normal operations of an emulated device to formulate an execution specification. The specification acts as a criterion to evaluate the device's behavior and state transitions. We implement SEDSpec, a prototype system that automatically generates the execution specification for an emulated device and devises three check strategies for identifying any deviations from this specification, thereby ensuring normal operations and enhancing the security of the emulated device. We evaluate SEDSpec with five different execution specifications. The results show that SEDSpec can detect anomalies caused by vulnerability exploitation while maintaining the devices' regular functioning with minimal performance overhead.},

  author={Xu, Shaowen and Zhou, Qihang and Huang, Heqing and Jia, Xiaoqi and Du, Haichao and Chen, Yang and Xie, Yamin},
  abstract={Microservice application architecture is one of the most widely used service architectures in the industry. To prevent a compromised microservice from abusing other microservices, authorization policy is applied to regulate the access among them. However, configuring access control policy manually is challenging due to the complexity and dynamic nature of microservice applications. In this paper, we present Log2Policy, a novel approach to generate microservice authorization policy based on access logs. Our approach consists of three fundamental techniques: (1) a log-based topological graph generation mechanism that automatically infers the invocation logic among microservices, (2) a machine learning based attributes mining method that extracts the relevant attributes of requests, and (3) a policy upgrade mechanism based on traffic management that can significantly reduce the upgrade time. We have implemented a prototype of Log2Policy on mainstream microservice infrastructures and have evaluated it with several microservice applications. The results show that Log2Policy can generate fine-grained and effective access control rules and upgrade them with negligible overhead.},

  author={Tai, Jianwei and Jia, Xiaoqi and Huang, Qingjia and Zhang, Weijuan and Du, Haichao and Zhang, Shengzhi},
  abstract={Speaker verification, as a biometric authentication mechanism, has been widely used due to the pervasiveness of voice control on smart devices. However, the task of “in-the-wild” speaker verification is still challenging, considering the speech samples may contain lots of identity-unrelated information, e.g., background noise, reverberation, emotion, etc. Previous works focus on optimizing the model to improve verification accuracy, without taking into account the elimination of the impact from the identity-unrelated information. To solve the above problem, we propose SEEF-ALDR, a novel Speaker Embedding Enhancement Framework via Adversarial Learning based Disentangled Representation, to reinforce the performance of existing models on speaker verification. The key idea is to retrieve as much speaker identity information as possible from the original speech, thus minimizing the impact of identity-unrelated information on the speaker verification task by using adversarial learning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly improve the performance of speaker verification by 20.3\% and 23.8\% on average over 13 tested baselines on dataset Voxceleb1 and 8 tested baselines on dataset Voxceleb2 respectively, without adjusting the structure or hyper-parameters of them. Furthermore, the ablation study was conducted to evaluate the contribution of each module in SEEF-ALDR. Finally, porting an existing model into the proposed framework is straightforward and cost-efficient, with very little effort from the model owners due to the modular design of the framework.},

  abstract={Despite the remarkable progress made in synthesizing emotional speech from text, it is still challenging to provide emotion information to existing speech segments. Previous methods mainly rely on parallel data, and few works have studied the generalization ability for one model to transfer emotion information across different languages. To cope with such problems, we propose an emotion transfer system named ET-GAN, for learning language-independent emotion transfer from one emotion to another without parallel training samples. Based on cycle-consistent generative adversarial network, our method ensures the transfer of only emotion information across speeches with simple loss designs. Besides, we introduce an approach for migrating emotion information across different languages by using transfer learning. The experiment results show that our method can efficiently generate high-quality emotional speech for any given emotion category, without aligned speech pairs.},

  title={EnclavePDP: A General Framework to Verify Data Integrity in Cloud Using Intel SGX},
  author={He, Yun and Xu, Yihua and Jia, Xiaoqi and Zhang, Shengzhi and Liu, Peng and Chang, Shuai},
  abstract={As the cloud storage service becomes pervasive, verifying the integrity of their outsourced data on cloud remotely turns out to be challenging for users. Existing Provable Data Possession (PDP) schemes mostly resort to a Third Party Auditor (TPA) to verify the integrity on behalf of users, thus reducing their communication and computation burden. However, such schemes demand fully trusted TPA, that is, placing TPA in the Trusted Computing Base (TCB), which is not always a reasonable assumption. In this paper, we propose EnclavePDP, a secure and general data integrity verification framework that relies on Intel SGX to establish the TCB for PDP schemes, thus eliminating the TPA from the TCB. EnclavePDP supports both new and existing PDP schemes by integrating core functionalities of cryptography libraries into Intel SGX. We choose 10 existing representative PDP schemes, and port them into EnclavePDP with reasonable effort. By deploying EnclavePDP in a real-world cloud storage platform and running the 10 PDP schemes respectively, we demonstrate that EnclavePDP can eliminate the dependence on TPA and introduce reasonable performance overhead.},
